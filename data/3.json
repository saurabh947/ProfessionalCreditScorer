The company had complex compliance requirements due to the nature of the business and Michelle’s ability to absorb and manage that level of risk helped the organization achieve new levels of success. Michelle was able to build a team that helped effectively manage GRC risks at all levels of the organization and interface effectively with executive leadership as well as key stake holders such as legal and finance teams.  Through Michelle’s leadership, her team was able to effectively navigate internal and external auditors that ensuring that the organization was fully compliant with all obligations and ensure the business would continue to run with no issues.

    "headline": "Founding Engineer, ONDEMANDENV | Championing Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) & Contract-First Architectures | AWS Terraform CDK, CDK8s& Event-Driven Systems",
    "about": "With over 15 years of architecting and delivering robust Java enterprise solutions, I’ve cultivated a deep mastery of object-oriented design, domain-driven systems, and the art of turning complex business problems into elegant technical realities. My journey began in the trenches of monolithic architectures, but today, I channel that expertise into redefining how distributed systems evolve at scale—because modern infrastructure shouldn’t just work; it should orchestrate itself.\n\nAs the creator of ondemandenv, I’ve built a paradigm-shifting platform that treats infrastructure as a collaborative domain-driven ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from DDD’s bounded contexts and federalist governance, the platform enables teams to version, contract, and clone environments (“Envers”) with surgical precision—dissolving age-old AWS deployment deadlocks (like cross-region CloudFormation dependencies) by design. By codifying architectural agreements into a ContractsLib (a constitutional layer for distributed systems), I’ve proven that microservices chaos isn’t inevitable—it’s just a failure of domain modeling.\n\nMy philosophy?\nInfrastructure is too critical to be left to ad-hoc scripts. Just as OOP taught us to encapsulate state and behavior, modern cloud-native systems demand contractual clarity and environment-as-code rigor. Whether I’m guiding teams to untangle dependency webs or advocating for systems that self-heal through event-driven automation, my mission remains the same: to turn infrastructure into a living, collaborative language—one where every line of CDK code reflects a shared understanding.\n\nLet’s connect if you’re passionate about:\n🔹 DDD for infrastructure – Modeling AWS resources as domain entities.\n🔹 Decentralized autonomy – Enabling teams to innovate without fracturing systems.\n🔹 Killing deployment deadlocks – With contracts, not workarounds.\n\nP.S. If you’ve ever lost sleep over CloudFormation rollbacks or circular dependencies, I’d love to show you how Envers turn “impossible” problems into yesterday’s constraints.\n\nP.S. If you’ve ever lost sleep over Cursor AI piled up unpredictable system, I’d love to show you how I decomposed mountains of generated code into separated and isolated vertical implementations.",

We actively seek to free up time and capacity for you , which releases bandwidth, allowing you to focus on and pursue whatever is most important.

We aspire to work with people we like and respect . . .who hopefully feel similarly about us. We are building relationships, not brokering transactions.

The CT Challenge, The Norwalk Community College Foundation, The New York Executive Board of Harlem Lacrosse and The Open Doors Shelter in Norwalk, CT.\r\n\r\nRead is an avid reader (disclaimer - listener via Audible), a bad golfer, a mediocre cross fitter and steadfastly refuses to quit playing lacrosse.",

As someone who has to deal with nearly every department, his communication skills, and ability to explain complex security topics to non-technical staff is a valuable asset at Tapad.\n\nThere’s no drama with him, just give him a security project, and he’ll get it done.\n\nGood luck in all you do Ben!"

        "publishedAt": "APress · May 23, 2023",
        "description": "This book is your go-to reference on how to achieve PCI compliance. With more than 400 PCI requirements, the updated PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) v4.0 does not detail the specific documentation that a PCI auditor―known as a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)―needs to know. This book is the first reference to detail the specific documentation needed for every PCI requirement. The authors provide real-world examples of complying with the 12 main PCI requirements and clarify many of the gray areas within the PCI DSS.\nAny merchant or service provider that stores, processes, or transmits credit card data must comply with the PCI Data Security Standard. PCI DSS 1.0 was first published in 2004, yet many of those tasked with PCI compliance still encounter difficulties when trying to make sense of it. PCI DSS version 4 was published in March 2022, and at 360 pages, it has numerous additional requirements, leaving many people struggling to know what they need to do to comply.\n\nPCI DSS v4.0 has a transition period in which PCI DSS version 3.2.1 will remain active for two years from the v4.0 publication date. Although the transition period ends on March 31, 2024, and may seem far away, those tasked with PCI compliance will need every bit of the time to acquaint themselves with the many news updates, templates, forms, and more, that PCI v4.0 brings to their world.\n\nYou will:\n\n    Know what it takes to be PCI compliant\n    Understand and implement what is in the PCI DSS\n    Get rid of cardholder data\n    Have everything you need to know about segmenting your cardholder data network\n    Know what documentation is needed for your PCI compliance efforts\n    Leverage real-world experience to assist PCI compliance work",

I am executive vice president, chief marketing officer (and alchemist-in-residence) at Randa Apparel & Accessories, a multinational consumer products business and one of the world's leading fashion and lifestyle companies.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in the consumer products industry, I specialize in identifying and applying actionable insights, data, story-telling, technology, analytics, and behavioral economics to understand and influence consumer behavior. \n\nI am honored to collaborate with outstanding executives on strategy, P&L, M&A, Artificial Intelligence, and digital transformation. \n\nI have oversight of cross-functional teams and agencies across multiple geographies and am responsible for the management of our owned and licensed brand portfolio, consumer insights, intellectual property, and integrated marketing.\n\nIt is my good fortune to collaborate with remarkable brands, including Levi’s, Haggar, Dickies, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Columbia Sportswear, Cole Haan, Ralph Lauren, Totes, Isotoner, and Tommy Bahama.\n\nAs an alchemist, I transmute marketing into revenues at 20,000 points of sale (and millions of page views) inclusive of Macy’s, Kohl’s, Amazon, Nordstrom, JCPenney, Walmart, Target, Costco, Liverpool, Marks & Spencer, Printemps, and El Cortes Ingles.\n\nStimulus and response often derive from sharing great stories, I am privileged to speak in public, co-author a best-selling book, and have published many articles. My words and exploits have been shared in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, CNN, The New York Times, Business Insider, New York Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, Huffington Post, and other media.\n\nThroughout my career, I have been influenced by great companies and leaders, including American Express, Red Cats, QVC, and McKinsey & Company. In particular, I am inspired & challenged by my extraordinary CEO at Randa Apparel & Accessories. \n\nALCHEMY: A science or philosophy that transforms something ordinary into something extraordinary, often through mysterious means.\n\nWe cannot navigate a new landscape with old maps. \n\nMEETING REQUESTS:\n\nPlease research our company and provide concrete recommendations on how you can add value, your business model, cost metrics, and relevant references so we may respond appropriately.  \n\nYou should visit www.randa.net, www.shoptribalfashion.com, www.totes.com, and www.haggar.com. \n\nContact information is available at https://randa.net/contact.",

        "description": "ON VIEW: MAY 18-27, 2024\n\n\nAcclaimed Indian-American Artist (and Investment Banker) Creating a Unique Path in the United States\n\nSaphira & Ventura Gallery is thrilled to announce solo art show titled “NIRVANA: My Journey Transcending Philosophies” of the internationally recognized artist Vikash Jha featuring selected works created during the last six years. The show will feature works from his art series such as ‘introspection’, ‘transcendence’, ‘confluence’, and ‘global warming’.\n\nAs a contemporary abstract expressionist, in his artistic practice, Jha seamlessly intertwines colors, cross-cultural imageries, and philosophies inspired by his upbringing in India and his experiences as an immigrant to the United States. His works reflect a continuous examination of social, cultural, and philosophical issues, capturing the essence of his intellectual curiosity and exploration through unique and contemporary depictions.\n\nEmploying a diverse range of mixed media including acrylic, oil, charcoal, pastels, and upcycled materials, Jha’s growing body of works are characterized by their rich texture and layered complexity. He draws inspiration from modern masters like Picasso, de Kooning, Rauschenberg, Basquiat, Joan Mitchell, Rothko, Pollock, Gaitonde, Hussain, among others. \n",

The combination of investor liquidity, substantial portfolio illiquidity, weak valuation policies and non-traditional compensation methodologies not ideal for an illiquid portfolio allow for conflicts and may harm both manager and investor alike. Designing the proper fund structure and implementing effective policies on valuation, marketing and governance, promote sound management and provide valuable safeguards against regulatory action.",

Failure to properly structure your firm will have material opportunity costs. A firm with structural issues is less likely to attract investment and more likely to be plagued with investor litigation, regulatory prosecution, limitation on capital resources and reputational damage. In many cases, the costs associated with fixing a problem far exceed the costs of doing the job correctly at the outset. In certain cases, the problems cannot be fixed.",

        "description": "I came to know Dr. Suzanne Weiss when she was hired by my organization, Newark Community Health Centers, Inc., which is a federally qualified health center (FQHC). At the time, I was the Director of Adult Medicine. My organization was preparing for NCQA Level 3 certification and Dr. Weiss, with her medical expertise and strong healthcare IT background, was hired to assist us in designing the appropriate templates and then to guide our physicians in the new formatting in our clinics. During her time with us, we received our NCQA Level 3 certification. Apart from this undertaking, Dr. Weiss assessed our needs using our software, eClinical Works (eCW), for all our clinical encounters. She clearly understood that the vendor's clinical manual, at 425 pages, would never work for us. She created a new, more useful manual of 38 pages. In addition, using her extensive art background, she utilized Microsoft Publisher to create a trifold for physicians who could use these necessary shortcuts to guide their documentation during clinical rounds. Dr. Weiss is gifted and rare, in that she can use her years in clinical medicine, take that level of understanding and combine it with her role as a subject matter expert on the Healthcare IT side. She serves as the necessary \"bridge\" between the clinical staff (her peers), the IT department, the C-Suite personnel and the vendor. She has a clear understanding of all sides and knows how to execute the necessary improvements. It was a pleasure working with Dr. Weiss over the many months she was with us. If the occasion should arise, I would welcome the opportunity to work with her again."

Her role was as an intermediary between our Clinical staff, IT, and our E.H.R vendor.\n\nSuzanne was excellent in this capacity!\n\nAs a physician herself, she was able to empathize with our Clinical staff. Having worked with other E.H.R platforms, she was able to explain that all systems have their drawbacks, and the key was to identify what was most important to the Clinical staff. Dr. Weiss was also able to bring examples of issues and errors to our E.H.R vendor meetings. She was a strong voice on behalf of our Clinical users.\n\nI would definitely hire Suzanne again in this role."

    "about": "I work with Series A to C companies to scale their GTM without scaling headcount, and help their existing teams winning faster. I build strategic, bespoke and highly customized revenue systems. \n\nWhether teams are flooded with inbound leads they can’t qualify or building new account lists to expand: There's more data than anyone can process manually. \n\nOutreach channels are packed, and GTM playbooks are supplemented - and in parts overtaken - by AI assisted, bespoke systems. \n\nIf your best salesperson had unlimited time to research every account, who would they pick, what would they want to know and say? That's what I build at scale.\n\nI build automated systems that completely change how you spot and connect with ideal customers. \n\nThese systems can find insights that used to require hours of manual research - from earnings call transcripts to website details to hiring patterns - and turn them into actionable signals at scale. \n\nInstead of relying on basic firmographics, you can now identify prospects based on the rich, specific data points. \n\nWe can start with validating the right qualification process for your business, then gradually automate and integrate each piece into your existing systems. \n\nWhether you want to start small with better qualification or build toward a fully automated workflow, these systems adapt to how your team works - from feeding insights into your CRM to handling outreach automatically. \n\n—-\n15+ years of international, multi-domain, multi-functional experience at Apple and B2B scale-ups. Expertise in applied LLMs, productivity, AI, Sales, GTM, Growth, Account Management, Team Leadership, Recruiting, and Project Management\n\nFun fact 🌋: I’ve been inside an active volcano.",

He brought a lot of positive energy to every conversation with customers and made sure the handover to customer success was as smooth as it could be. He's both a strong individual contributor and team player, and really fun to work with! \n\nAndreas has a positive mindset, and I experienced him as a very dynamic and flexible colleague. He was able to adapt to changing priorities as required, eager to learn new things and to be challenged, and always keen to find better ways to get things done. I'm happy to recommend Andreas for any customer-facing team, and wish him well personally and professionally!"

What started as a consultant engagement turned into a journey of innovation, passion and excitement, all instilled by the vision showed by Anil. While leading a big group, Anil took care of knowing and forming a personal relationship with each and every individual in the portfolio. He is able to look into you, identify hidden possibilities that maybe even you did not know and gives you the platform to rise and truly shine. I would call Anil a true visionary and a constant support system. What struck me most is that while it is fantastic to be celebrated at times of success, Anil was by our side at challenging times too, forsaking his sleep to be the captain of the ship, inspiring us as we battled the waves. I thank him for being my teacher and mentor and look forward to continuing my tutelage under his wings."

Over the past years, I have been working on and developing a new company, UBsports, which is erasing the many inefficiencies in the athlete and sports communities (particularly the most widely played sports..not the sports you would think!) giving athletes and coaches their own sports-centric social network, and creating a new paradigm in Web video for sports.\n\nSpecialties: Business management, Business plan development and rollout, creative development of synergistic relationships and communities, Sales and contact development, strategic marketing and  relationship development.",

What happens though when you try to contain fire goes from limiting all applications to said manager’s understanding (short ceiling) or choking out the fire. I wonder what will happen if we did the opposite - like grabbing more wood for the fire to consume or allowing for combustion? I definitely feel privileged being able to witness, utilize and collaborate with him.\n\nMohamed or Mo and I met in non-ordinary circumstances which already says plenty about him - he is a focused individual who is not afraid to make mistakes who can both make business cases for technology or technology use cases for a business. He aspires for greatness - though he already is great, he is humble and continuing to learn. He has so much potential because he is able to apply most of his learnings into practical use in business and/or technology. He is extremely innovative because he isn’t afraid to try nor too prideful to fail - he simply yearns to apply his knowledge to the best possible solution today no matter the situation\n\nIf you’re thinking of hiring Mohamed, please do yourself a favor and do not ask “is Mo a good candidate?” Instead, ask yourself, “can my organization handle a person like Mo?” or “is my organization prepared to listen to new ideas so we can breakthrough our ceiling?”\n\nOr simply put - when you see fire, does it make you think of getting burned or does it make you think of combustion engines and thermal energy that will propel your organization into the next technological age?"

        "description": "Through a chance meeting, Marty and I began working together on several projects, and I’m excited about the many more collaborations ahead.\n\nOne of Marty’s unique superpowers is his knack for asking questions or making observations—whether in casual chats or formal discussions—that cut straight to the heart of the matter. His ability to clarify ideas and illuminate the path forward is remarkable. This skill, sharpened through years on Wall Street, in academia, and advising family offices and institutional investors, allows him to uncover meaning and value in even the smallest interactions. His questions may seem simple at first, but like a skilled detective, Marty uses them to uncover new perspectives and deeper understanding.\n\nYour response to Marty matters. Approach him with defensiveness, condescension, or empty rhetoric, and you may lose his interest quickly. But if you engage thoughtfully and collaborate with him, you’ll find a partner whose ability to create opportunities and open doors is truly unmatched."

        "description": "I worked with Mili on my job search in 2023.  She was recommended by a friend who has worked with her in the past.  My first impression was how much time she put in my resume content before scheduling a call with me.  By the time we got on the call, she knew every point of my resume including my experience, the layout of the resume, the clarity of the message, and ALL the details my professional resume checker did not see.  During the first call, we spent 1hr talking about my background, the opportunities she was seeng in the market and what companies were looking for after covid-19.  In the next call, we focused on business model/area where she thought I will have chance of success, she made sure my experience was told through my resume in simple language with clear and measurable results.\n\nWithin two weeks, I had interview lined up and that was the only interview I had and got offer within 24hrs.  She negotiated all the contract conditions on my behalf after I told her what I wanted and the contract was more than perfect.\nMili is that person who takes every candidate like a personal challenge and puts incredible time with all the details.  She can make you feel like your resume was written by 8th grade student.  She asks very smart and detailed questions in order for her to find a good fit for you.  She is not someone who sends your resume to any company just to get you a job.  Her logic is that a candidate should get a job which matches the candidate aspirations and should be the candidate dream job.  Her time spent to matching candidate background and candidate next job is incredible.  I would commend Mili to anybody who wants to get next big bang, global companies and global brands.  She works with big international and global companies"

If you haven't been happy with traditional agency recruiters, how about considering someone from a non-traditional background?\n\nMy story goes Math+Astrophysics->C# Test Code at Microsoft->Technical Recruiter->HR Director->Recruiting Agency owner. Here's how each of my experiences shaped me:\n\nScience: I learned about asking questions and making observations. \nTesting: I learned to question those and stay skeptical. \nIn-house recruiting: I gained an obsession with finding great, long-term fits that solve business problems rather than making placements. \nHR: I care very much about each candidate as a person, and treat each client's business as my own.\n\nWhen you work with me, you get:\nWhite glove service for both you and your candidates, never ghosting\nFlexible payment terms (hourly preferred, retained/contingent possible)\nFlexible work arrangement (I can do anything you need done, from spinning up a role from scratch to close, or pick things up at any stage along the way)\nGreat at building or streamlining processes that are designed with pragmatism in mind\nCan work as an embedded member of your team\n\nBTW, I'm a digital nomad, thus not available for onsite roles in NYC. It's where I have my strongest network, however.\n\nIf anything I blabber about is helpful, would you get me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tatiana_kristine",

She didn’t try to build a brand-new process from scratch—but she was quick to spot the gaps, step in where it mattered, and make everything work better.\n\nShe treated candidates like real people, not just profiles, and she worked closely with me throughout—sharing insights, adjusting in real-time, and staying tightly aligned. We were often in total agreement on who was a fit and why, which made everything move faster and smoother.\n\nShe rolled up her sleeves to help with screening, interviews, and running a hiring process that actually worked. She even flew to India to support our hiring efforts on the ground—huge commitment.\n\nOn top of all that, her business model just made sense. No outrageous fees—just solid work and great results. She earned every bit of it.\n\nIf you're looking for a recruiter who’s collaborative, empathetic, and all-in on helping you succeed, talk to Tatiana. She’s the real deal."

Thanks in part to her science and technical background, she was able to quickly identify job opportunities that fit my profile perfectly. I had also done my own thorough research of the job marked, but Tatiana helped me identify other very interesting opportunities that I would have missed on my own. I was very impressed by the quality of Tatiana's work.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Tatiana was able to arrange several interviews with tech companies in a matter of days, and also gave me excellent advice for the interviews. We worked as a team during my job search, and my experience working with Tatiana was very helpful in eventually getting a great job in R&D.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "about": "\"Divorce is both a legal battle and an emotional war zone—yet most people only prepare for one.\"\n\nI'm Poonam Bhuchar—TEDx speaker, bestselling author of SAFE from the Pain, 24-year attorney, and divorce coach. After spending time in the courtroom and surviving my own traumatic divorce, I realized something powerful:\n\n👉 People don’t just need a lawyer.\n👉 They need someone who understands the emotional chaos, the identity loss, and the decision paralysis that come with ending a marriage.\n\nThat’s why I created the SAFE Method—a unique framework that blends Stop, Accept, Forgive, and Embrace to guide professionals, women, and high-net-worth individuals through the most destabilizing transitions of their lives.\n\n🔹 Who I Help:\nIndividuals ready to rebuild after divorce—without shame or second-guessing.\n\nProfessionals & executives facing emotional burnout from personal upheaval.\n\nCorporations seeking to support employee wellbeing during major life transitions.\n\nMedia and platforms looking for expert commentary on emotional resilience, divorce, and legal strategy.\n\n🔹 Why Work With Me?\nI’m not just a coach—I’m a seasoned attorney who’s handled hundreds of complex divorce cases.  I help you with the emotional aspect, paperwork, guidance based on my legal knowledge and discuss how to get what you want based on your values and needs all without being billed per hour.\n\nI’ve been featured on TEDx, Forbes Riley, David Meltzer, and co-authored a book with Les Brown.\n\nI’ve built strategic partnerships with wealth managers, debt experts, and estate planners to support the full divorce journey.\n\n🔹 Ready to Take the Next Step?\nLet’s talk if you're:\n\nNavigating a divorce and feel stuck in overwhelm\n\nLooking for a powerful speaker on emotional wellbeing & resilience\n\nA company ready to support your employees through major life shifts\n\n\n📅 Book a consultation or media inquiry via my profile\n\n\nTestimonials:\n“Poonam’s empathy, care, and support were instrumental during my divorce. Her continuous advice and support have been a lifeline.” – Sunita\n“Poonam brought warmth and knowledge to our conference, offering invaluable strategies for self-care and resilience.” – Sarah Carvajal, PA Health Council\n“Poonam’s presentation on corporate burnout was enlightening and inspiring, providing actionable insights and personal stories.” – Women Resource Group, Pfizer",

        "description": "Three concepts come to mind when reflecting on my work with Tomas Chadwick – he is tenacious, he is persistent, and he gets things done.  Even though Tomas comes from the finance world, he operates unlike any other finance leader I have worked with in the past.  With a sense of urgency, he has great clarity in breaking down walls, and Tomas is not afraid to think out of the box to come up with creative solutions to challenging problems.  I have seen Tomas navigate challenging situations with great grace, and I have learned a lot from his ability to get things done.  Personally, I have been the better for having had the opportunity to work closely with Tomas."
