List of techniques involved; statistical process control (SPC), continuous improvement plan (CIP), failure mode & effect analysis (FMEA), and issue resolution documentation (8D). \n• Project Leader for a team tasked to solve a lifting metal gate issue. Using experience, data analysis, and experimentation found it to be a pre-clean prior to polysilicon deposition leaving a residue on the surface of the wafer affecting adhesion of the polysilicon material to the high-k dielectric. Final resolution was to change the equipment configuration differences found during an equipment audit. The yield loss was >30% equaling >75 die per wafer. The loss in revenue was $5500 per wafer, and >30,000 wafers shipped per month. \n• Process innovation solving a small defect issue resulting in a die loss of >5%. The issue was resolved using experiments to analyze defect data, versus slot/equipment order. Final resolution was traced to de-conditioning of the equipment by incorrect automation setup. Collaborated with automation software developers to correct modeling and equipment automation setup. Developed a new model, system setup, testing, specifications, and documentation resulting in elimination of the die loss. ",

        "publishedAt": "Intel Corporation · Nov 1, 2005",
        "description": "The targeting of transistor gate length is a primary driver of device performance. The targeting of the physical gate critical dimension (CD) greatly impacts the electrical gate dimension. Traditionally, continual monitoring and manual offsets to compensate for lithographic and etch equipment variability have been used to control gate CDs. The paper discusses how advanced process control techniques were applied to the 0.13micron polysilicon patterning process. Both scanner and etch equipment were controlled using a combination of feedfoward and feedback loops. As a result, significant engineering labor was saved, and gate CD 3 sigma results improved 12%, correlating to improved device performance and enhanced yield."

There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing a team come together, gain clarity on their goals, and build momentum that carries them forward.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve focused on bringing structure to fast-moving environments—helping teams find the right balance between process and adaptability. Scaling a team isn’t just about hitting numbers; it’s about setting a foundation that allows people to thrive and do their best work. By focusing on the right mix of people, processes, and tools, I’ve helped organizations grow in a way that’s both impactful and sustainable.\n\nFor me, success comes down to clear communication, trust, and a shared commitment to something bigger than any one person. I’m driven by the opportunity to help people and businesses unlock their potential, and I believe the best results come when everyone feels connected to the bigger picture.",

        "description": "I first met Matt while interviewing at Informatica for an open sales role. Immediately I was impressed with Matt as most Directors that interview IC roles never seemed as genuine as Matt did.  That day Matt took me on a tour, showed me around and spoke to the vision and goals of the executive team. I left that day thinking if I don’t get the role, at the very least my network just picked up a heavy hitter. Fast forward 7 years, Matt reached out to me via LinkedIn.  We travel in the same circle of groups, people and of course tech news. We would see each other in the “hallways” but never crossed paths until he reached out just to let me know that he was available if I needed anything as I just was laid off. Long story short, I took him up on that offer and asked for some guidance. Not only did Matt go out of his way to lend an ear but he called and proceeded to share what you would consider an consultant’s brief. When a totally stranger interrupts your day, has an ask that is selfishly one sided and needs your response within 3 hours, most of us would not take the time to accommodate.  Matt is not like that, he leads when no one is watching, he mentors when there is no monetary benefit and he supports with out the need for praise, acknowledgment or FB posts. The man is a cold stone professional and someone who at the end of the day is authentic! \n\nTo top all of the personal integrity he shows, and the emotional strength, he is a master in his field: \n\n- Consultive Problem Solving \n- Networking\n- Data Governance\n- Business Development\n- Leadership \n- Mentoring \n\nJust to name a few. I highly recommend that you stop, grab a cup of coffee with Matt.  If you do, you will walk away better and unknowingly will have gained a friend and human that is going to show up 100% daily! \n\n"

At times these colleagues can be demanding, but you understand that supporting these folks is valuable because they are good at what they do. Matt was one of the most collaborative and resourceful Sales team members that I worked with during our time at Collibra. On top of that, it was evident that Matt genuinely cared about his team and was driven by their collective success. These are traits that shouldn't be taken for granted, and will serve him well for years to come."

It applies whether your data is structured or unstructured, whether your organisation is large or small; whatever type of organisation you work for. Crossing the Data Delta presents an agile approach to driving digital value in your organisation. It provides a clarion call to treat data as an asset.\nThe valuation of a modern organisation depends upon the quality of its data. Turning accurate, complete, timely, secure data into business intelligence is how organisations will win the data wars of the 21st century. Crossing the Data Delta tells you exactly how to do that.",

        "description": "Some over-etch (OE) related defects in semiconductor device processing are only obvious after vias or trenches are already filled. Such defects are usually buried and often discovered after failure analysis from failed devices. Inline detection by physical means using optical inspection tools is not possible. e-Beam inspection has the ability to detect this type of defect electrically. OE related defects create shorts or leakage paths and their ability to cause device failure depends on the level or extent of this leakage. Hard OE fail impacts yield while marginal OE is relatively harmless. e-Beam inspection detects both hard OE fail and marginal OE as bright voltage contrast (BVC) and it has always been a challenge to discern yield impacting hard OE fail from the relatively harmless OE based only on the defect images. TEM analysis is often necessary to distinguish between the two. In this paper attempt is made to relate the extent of OE to e-Beam defect detection parameters, Threshold (TH) and Grey Level (GLV). Correlation between the amount of OE and each of the two parameters is established. Also a correlation is found among the two parameters themselves. With these relationships established, the e-Beam defect detection parameters alone can be used to predict OE’s potential impact on yield without TEM analysis.\n\n© (2021) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

        "description": "Shrinking design rule coupled with complex device geometries and introduction of new materials in the manufacturing of today’s semiconductor devices generate inherent device weak points which in turn give rise to mechanisms that result in yield impacting defects. The development and introduction of finFET has helped considerably in the quest to further shrink design rule. However, the design and complex manufacturing process involved in producing these high performance finFET devices bring with it a whole new class of defects that have considerable impact on device performance and yield. Some of these defects are buried beneath the wafer surface and are very difficult to detect. They are often missed by optical inspection, only to cause fails at final testing. Failure analysis (FA) then becomes the only means by which they are uncovered. FA is a destructive methodology and its benefits are realized only after the fact. Unlike FA, e-Beam inspection is non-destructive. e-Beam uses electron optics and has a unique ability to detect buried defects electrically by contrast (VC) between a defective structure and its reference. As process window gets tighter and tighter process margin becomes difficult to predict. In this work, e-Beam inspection and overlay data is used to identify process weakness regions on wafer to predict fails and help optimize process and improve yield.",
