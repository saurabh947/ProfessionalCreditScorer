Using experience, data analysis, and experimentation found it to be a pre-clean prior to polysilicon deposition leaving a residue on the surface of the wafer affecting adhesion of the polysilicon material to the high-k dielectric. Final resolution was to change the equipment configuration differences found during an equipment audit. The yield loss was >30% equaling >75 die per wafer. The loss in revenue was $5500 per wafer, and >30,000 wafers shipped per month. \n• Process innovation solving a small defect issue resulting in a die loss of >5%. The issue was resolved using experiments to analyze defect data, versus slot/equipment order. Final resolution was traced to de-conditioning of the equipment by incorrect automation setup.

The targeting of the physical gate critical dimension (CD) greatly impacts the electrical gate dimension. Traditionally, continual monitoring and manual offsets to compensate for lithographic and etch equipment variability have been used to control gate CDs. The paper discusses how advanced process control techniques were applied to the 0.13micron polysilicon patterning process. Both scanner and etch equipment were controlled using a combination of feedfoward and feedback loops. As a result, significant engineering labor was saved, and gate CD 3 sigma results improved 12%, correlating to improved device performance and enhanced yield."

It began with strategic planning, interviewing, and hiring 12 high-potential individuals to create a customer-facing, user-centric team focused on end-user IT support across distributed business sites. The program focused on not just technical proficiency but also the development of critical soft skills like professional presence, communication, time-management, scope boundaries, and fostering team camaraderie. Through structured in-person training sessions and cross-training opportunities, the team learned to establish stakeholder relationships, integrate into manufacturing and research environments, and represent elevated professional standards. Team and individual accountability measurements and best practices were implemented, ensuring consistent service delivery within key stakeholder communities. The result was a strongly grounded, adaptable team that became a model of technical service delivery which enhanced the employee experience across the region.",

There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing a team come together, gain clarity on their goals, and build momentum that carries them forward.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve focused on bringing structure to fast-moving environments—helping teams find the right balance between process and adaptability. Scaling a team isn’t just about hitting numbers; it’s about setting a foundation that allows people to thrive and do their best work. By focusing on the right mix of people, processes, and tools, I’ve helped organizations grow in a way that’s both impactful and sustainable.\n\nFor me, success comes down to clear communication, trust, and a shared commitment to something bigger than any one person. I’m driven by the opportunity to help people and businesses unlock their potential, and I believe the best results come when everyone feels connected to the bigger picture.",

        "description": "I first met Matt while interviewing at Informatica for an open sales role. Immediately I was impressed with Matt as most Directors that interview IC roles never seemed as genuine as Matt did.  That day Matt took me on a tour, showed me around and spoke to the vision and goals of the executive team. I left that day thinking if I don’t get the role, at the very least my network just picked up a heavy hitter. Fast forward 7 years, Matt reached out to me via LinkedIn.  We travel in the same circle of groups, people and of course tech news. We would see each other in the “hallways” but never crossed paths until he reached out just to let me know that he was available if I needed anything as I just was laid off. Long story short, I took him up on that offer and asked for some guidance. Not only did Matt go out of his way to lend an ear but he called and proceeded to share what you would consider an consultant’s brief. When a totally stranger interrupts your day, has an ask that is selfishly one sided and needs your response within 3 hours, most of us would not take the time to accommodate.  Matt is not like that, he leads when no one is watching, he mentors when there is no monetary benefit and he supports with out the need for praise, acknowledgment or FB posts. The man is a cold stone professional and someone who at the end of the day is authentic! \n\nTo top all of the personal integrity he shows, and the emotional strength, he is a master in his field: \n\n- Consultive Problem Solving \n- Networking\n- Data Governance\n- Business Development\n- Leadership \n- Mentoring \n\nJust to name a few. I highly recommend that you stop, grab a cup of coffee with Matt.  If you do, you will walk away better and unknowingly will have gained a friend and human that is going to show up 100% daily! \n\n"

It applies whether your data is structured or unstructured, whether your organisation is large or small; whatever type of organisation you work for. Crossing the Data Delta presents an agile approach to driving digital value in your organisation. It provides a clarion call to treat data as an asset.\nThe valuation of a modern organisation depends upon the quality of its data. Turning accurate, complete, timely, secure data into business intelligence is how organisations will win the data wars of the 21st century. Crossing the Data Delta tells you exactly how to do that.",

        "description": "Some over-etch (OE) related defects in semiconductor device processing are only obvious after vias or trenches are already filled. Such defects are usually buried and often discovered after failure analysis from failed devices. Inline detection by physical means using optical inspection tools is not possible. e-Beam inspection has the ability to detect this type of defect electrically. OE related defects create shorts or leakage paths and their ability to cause device failure depends on the level or extent of this leakage. Hard OE fail impacts yield while marginal OE is relatively harmless. e-Beam inspection detects both hard OE fail and marginal OE as bright voltage contrast (BVC) and it has always been a challenge to discern yield impacting hard OE fail from the relatively harmless OE based only on the defect images. TEM analysis is often necessary to distinguish between the two. In this paper attempt is made to relate the extent of OE to e-Beam defect detection parameters, Threshold (TH) and Grey Level (GLV). Correlation between the amount of OE and each of the two parameters is established. Also a correlation is found among the two parameters themselves. With these relationships established, the e-Beam defect detection parameters alone can be used to predict OE’s potential impact on yield without TEM analysis.\n\n© (2021) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

        "description": "Shrinking design rule coupled with complex device geometries and introduction of new materials in the manufacturing of today’s semiconductor devices generate inherent device weak points which in turn give rise to mechanisms that result in yield impacting defects. The development and introduction of finFET has helped considerably in the quest to further shrink design rule. However, the design and complex manufacturing process involved in producing these high performance finFET devices bring with it a whole new class of defects that have considerable impact on device performance and yield. Some of these defects are buried beneath the wafer surface and are very difficult to detect. They are often missed by optical inspection, only to cause fails at final testing. Failure analysis (FA) then becomes the only means by which they are uncovered. FA is a destructive methodology and its benefits are realized only after the fact. Unlike FA, e-Beam inspection is non-destructive. e-Beam uses electron optics and has a unique ability to detect buried defects electrically by contrast (VC) between a defective structure and its reference. As process window gets tighter and tighter process margin becomes difficult to predict. In this work, e-Beam inspection and overlay data is used to identify process weakness regions on wafer to predict fails and help optimize process and improve yield.",

    "about": "Experience in operations, services and sales at high growth enterprise software and services firms has helped me streamline processes and achieve goals. Innovative processes that leverage technology may be combined with proven approaches to lower operating costs most effectively.  I help teams penetrate new markets, flank competitors and solve business requirements thrust upon them by change in markets, technology or organizations. I've actively participated in the launch of a successful Wall Street IPO as VP of Sales and CEO of an AI software company including mergers and acquisitions, the sale of companies, and reorgs of public and private organizations. I have a leadership record with teams that enable change and innovation.\n\nCertified in project management methods, financial analysis, HR, marketing, excel, planning and strategy as a former consultant that rolled out sales methodologies at Accenture, Deloitte, SAP and Oracle, I am a walking catalyst for doing the right thing and innovating - a change management leader, who was selected manager of the year in multiple companies, my goal is to continue to enable meaningful change and opportunity for individuals and organizations while being a humble servant to others. Deep dives for years in Manufacturing, Healthcare, Public Sector, Transportation, Energy, and Hospitality and have resulted in knowledge of how things used to be done and an insatiable desire to make improvements in a lasting way.  Organizational Development, Team Selling, Project Management, and Change Management are rooted in related concepts which I have taught thousands to apply in a repeatable manner.  Change is more than People, Process and Technology - its a culture and effects Policy and creates Pain - and the pain of change is less than the pain of stagnation - so every organization must embrace these concepts in a very concrete manner to excel.  That's what I enable with a team that is drafted, volunteers and selected from the ranks of the willing. I focus on driving revenue growth, lowering operating costs and developing those with potential, while hiring right and training well for skills that create industry leading revenue and profit returns. While I have held jobs in TX, GA, MA, NY and CA, I grew up along the border in South Texas and spend time in West Texas, and enjoy my family, the outdoors especially including fly fishing in the Rockies when time permits.",

He’s whip smart, creative, innovative, analytical, focused, competent, personable, humble, witty, thoughtful, and just a real pleasure to be around. \n\nIn a deadline-driven environment, where co-worker interactions were mostly transactional, Chetan built an esprit de corps that naturally drew others to him. They sought his council as a subject matter expert on Medicaid rules engines, as a skilled software engineer, and as a general problem-solver.\n\nFor example, he identified and harnessed the talents of cross-functional teams across the organization to innovate an approach to address a complex client requirement. This is what a good leader does—identify people’s talents and maximizes them.\n\nThis was no easy task, yet he designed the architecture and developed a working prototype. He drove high-level executive meetings to convince client leadership to approve the budget to build a working solution based on Chetan’s prototype. \n\nHe led a team of developers, QA folks, and Business Analysts to successfully drive and deliver this project. He designed the application in such a way that it could easily be extended to programs that would be added in the future. As a direct result of his product design, the business generated half a million in revenue over a period of 6 moths. \n\nIn addition, he worked with me to develop a prototype for a training platform developed to house training and communication on complex ERP projects. He helped work out how to stand up the prototype and worked with me to convince leadership it was solution they should adopt. \n\nChetan is someone you want on your team or even better, leading your team. He’s a true colleague in every sense. Given his collaborative spirit, his success will always be the teams’ success. \n"

Project was live with customized development/support/delivery going on in a timely fashion. With his expertise he was able to breakdown problem in smaller digestible pieces for the team to work on. He was able to successfully drive-motivate team with on-time delivery of the features as well as enable the team to provide dedicated strong client support. In Ohio Project, he took initiative to identify pain-points and improve team work process by developing DB executor scripts and audit app that helped team productivity to grow and made work much easier for team. He is very conscientious and dedicated at his work. His expertise in Java Technology was valued highly in driving Ohio Project’s delivery and growth. His inclusive/adaptable/supportive -friendly leadership style also made work environment highly collaborative and productive. Best wishes to Chetan on his endeavors."

    "about": "I am a Senior Software Engineer at Amazon with a strong foundation in cloud-native application development, large-scale systems design, and identity and access management (IAM). My expertise spans a broad range of AWS services—such as ECS, Lambda, DynamoDB—and I draw on serverless architectures, microservices patterns, and AI-driven analytics to deliver secure, highly resilient, and data-informed solutions. Through hands-on leadership, I collaborate closely with a tech lead who has pioneered the integration of LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into our workflows, enhancing our ability to detect usage patterns and streamline authentication at massive scale.\n\nMy technical skill set includes Java, Python,  React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Terraform, among other technologies. Beyond coding, I excel at bridging technical depth with business value, ensuring that IAM solutions not only meet Amazon’s stringent security requirements but also evolve in response to dynamic customer needs. My past experience at Fortune 50 enterprises—like The Home Depot and Ford Motor Company—has honed my ability to move quickly from concept to production, applying rigorous TDD, IaC principles, and DevOps best practices to continuously improve quality and speed of delivery. I am a lifelong learner, excited to explore new technologies and approaches that drive impactful, secure, and forward-looking engineering outcomes.",

        "description": "During his time at Quellos/BlackRock, I had the opportunity to work with Graham on more than one occasion. The first was when he recruited me into the firm. Graham was able to not only describe the various business lines of the firm in a clear and concise manner, but also actively listened to my questions and correctly diagnosed where my background and aptitude was best placed. He is great at communicating throughout the process; the decision to join the firm was made easier as I always knew where I stood.\r\n\r\nAfter joining the firm, Graham worked on filling open positions within my group. Again he showed to be adept at classifying skillsets that made a candidate more or less likely to succeed in different roles. He has a strong eye for specific attributes of talent, and how that talent fits into a given role. His understanding of the various systems of capital markets, combined with his strong listening skills, makes him the best recruiter I have worked with."

Software development itself is being reinvented; leaders must re-imagine how humans and intelligent systems collaborate and organizations must rapidly transform to achieve and stay in leadership positions. Across ABBYY, OutSystems, Apttus, and momentiq.ai, I have transformed organizations by infusing AI into both what product is built and how it is built. I have acquired hands-on, intimate understanding of how to effectively use AI tools and systems in modern software development with a unique range of experience: from executive leader of 700+ engineers to a hands-on solopreneur developer shipping AI product. My servant-leadership style leverages this expertise to guide teams through disruption with empathy while instilling a metrics-driven, customer-obsessed culture in organizations.\n\nCompanies that fail to evolve will fade; those that adopt and adapt will thrive. My mission is to lead that (r)evolution—delivering AI-native products and platforms, transforming ways-of working, creating enduring customer value, and bringing meaning to innovative work.\n\nPlease reach out, let’s have a conversation.",

    "about": "As a seasoned Global Procurement Leader with over two decades of experience, I bring expertise in strategic sourcing, vendor management, and procurement strategy in various industries, including energy, high-tech manufacturing, entertainment, healthcare, insurance, and financial services. \n\nStarting with a focus on IT strategic sourcing, my career trajectory has been characterized by continuous innovation, a robust reputation for creative and energizing approaches, and a commitment to risk management and risk management principles.\n\nMy tenure in the industry includes significant roles such as VP at Goldman Sachs, where I optimized global strategic sourcing and enhanced global vendor management capabilities, including increasing third-party minority business spend and leading policy and governance program development. \n\nAt MetLife, I managed a $2.5B global supply chain. At Electronic Arts, I controlled a $200M service line P&L. These roles underlined my ability to handle large-scale financial responsibilities and drive substantial savings.\n\nA key focus has been integrating empathetic leadership and personal integrity into my work ethic, fostering work cultures that promote team growth, accountability, and high morale. This approach has been instrumental in modernizing procurement processes, addressing challenges with outdated technology, and enhancing departmental efficiency and visibility. My efforts were recognized in 2021 when I was ranked 61st worldwide in Supply Chain Digital's list of top supply chain leaders.\n\nI have contributed to leading industry publications and shared insights at prestigious forums such as the Annual Supply Chain Summit. My articles in Procurement Magazine and Supply Chain Digest reflect my commitment to sharing knowledge and best practices in the field.\n\nIn my procurement roles at Goldman Sachs, MetLife, Acxiom, and EA, I led initiatives like innovative, streamlined procurement onboarding, which significantly reduced onboarding cycle time and enhanced efficiency and spend transparency, achieving a 50% decrease in infrastructure acquisition times. My introduction of Spend Analytics and Strategic Procurement programs realized over $45M in savings over three years and my governance in software licensing cut ghost spend by more than $3M. \n\nThese efforts demonstrate my agility in adapting to different corporate cultures and proficiency in navigating executive dynamics and implementing successful change management programs, always seeking to align initiatives with business goals.

    "about": "I am driven to find better, faster, more efficient ways of doing things.  Turning hours, into minutes, into seconds is at the core of every project we take on.  Today, with cloud, mobile and AI solutions, there has never been a better time to improve solutions across the board for equipment businesses.\n\nMy first career included working for a leading CAT tractor dealership.  During this first 17 years, I worked in practically every role at the machinery division, the last 9 as VP / GM of our Hyster forklift division.  During this time, we achieved several areas of unique distinction:\n\n* Highest market share for metro area dealership\n* Hyster Company Dealer of Distinction\n* First \"digital dealership\"; a study of our dealership called \"what it's like when it's right\"\n* Happy employees and customers validated by annual surveys\n\nMy second career has consisted of 18 + years getting into the weeds of digital transformation strategy and implementation plans.  Many OEM's and dealers have dated legacy systems that limit productivity that results in too much time spent on managing activities that could otherwise be streamlined and made to be more efficient.  Some of my 165 + projects have consisted of:\n\n* Free discovery calls and feedback, just to listen and offer help if needed\n* Automation of systems for outreach, including email, phone prospecting and Linkedin\n* A3 assessments, 90 day implementation plans, prospecting programs, fractional CMO work\n* Product messaging, value proposition development, advanced digital dealer development services\n* Platforms for buying &  selling equipment, inspection & pre-auction liquidation systems\n\nI always love connecting with visionary leaders that know there is a better way and are curious about how to get there without spending a fortune or being a project guinea pig.  \n\nCurrent Project(s): High Ticket Prospecting program for global OEM; REVOPS 360 program for leading edge financial services company.\n\nConnect with me if you're curious about the FX projects and how we can help!",

I started working with him a year ago to provide our services to build a brilliant marketplace platform. He has been a great client, up-to-date on the progress technology has made, understanding of the development progress and the components involved. His thorough preparedness helped us go through an organic process of scoping for our application, right from preparing the designs, detailed requirements documents, user stories and his valuable inputs to identify problems and propose solutions that make sense. As a team, we highly recommend his input on complex cloud, mobile and platform based solutions. He has a good network for various business opportunities, I highly recommend working with him."

What I've found great about working with Steve is his team-oriented mentality. He gives ample input, then consistently shows a willingness to step back and collaborate with the experts he's brought on to assist with the project.\n\nSpeaking specifically from a design and UX perspective, Steve has shown a genuine curiosity and respect for the craft that isn't commonly found across clientele. This is when the design process is at its best—informed by a domain expert who will patiently engage in a productive back and forth to educate the team and understand the resulting product.\n\nBeyond this, it's quite apparent that Steve cares about the projects he's working on and the people working on them—an attribute we can all appreciate."

    "about": "Mike began his career with Systematics, a cutting-edge banking software startup backed by Stephens Investments that eventually was acquired by FIS, the financial services software giant.  The financial models he wrote in 1982-83 are still running in their Bank Profitability Analysis System. \nAfter that, he worked at Merrill Lynch in New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London over a 15-year span, where he worked extensively across Infrastructure Technology, Back Office, Capital Markets , Private Client Technology, and on due diligence and integrations of Merrill purchased M&A transactions.     Post Merrill Lynch, he worked at Robertson Stephens, the legendary Investment Bank, as Global Head of Infrastructure Technology and then CIO/COO. \nHe then worked as CIO and Chief Operations Officer for Allstate Financial Services for eight years, where he led major digital transformation programs and  culminated in the end-to-end business process reengineering of the entire back office. \nHe finished his corporate career as CIO at Aflac before becoming the CEO of AppBus, a Fintech Software startup in Philadelphia, taking them through two funding rounds over four years. \nHe then joined Austin-based Ecliptic Capital as a Managing Partner investing in many deep science companies for its $65mm early-stage venture fund.   \n\nHe brings a wealth of experience to Sempulse, which he helped co-found nine years ago to help scale the company in his role as COO and Chief Business Development Officer. \n\nMike is an advisor to multiple startups and has had two board roles in Private Equity transactions with successful exits. \n\nHis goal is to devote the rest of his life to improving life on the planet, and Sempulse scratches that itch beautifully. \n\nHe loves his family and grandson, who he and Monica (his wife of 37 years) are raising. \n\nOther than work, his passions are: Travel, Food, Technology, Science, Golf, and Music. He is working with a production company to develop a television series he created on International Cuisine and Travel.",

He was a great collaborator; suggesting changes to our processes and interviewing, for the benefit of the candidates and Wheel.  I would LOVE to work with Greg again!"

        "description": "Greg has been an integral part of my team since I hired him at Binc. He's a natural when it comes to the immediate trust and rapport he can build with his hiring partners and stakeholders in addition to the lasting relationships I've seen him foster with his candidates well after they are hired. Greg also has a true passion for helping others that I have been able to witness firsthand and through positive peer feedback. At Binc, we are a distributed team of recruiters across the US and use Slack as a way to knowledge share/ask for help. There are countless examples of Greg volunteering his time to help strategize on a more complex technical sourcing strategy for a tough to fill role that a teammate may be struggling with to working on special projects that positively impacted Binc. I highly recommend Greg as an addition to any recruiting team looking to add a recruiter that goes above and beyond the scope of the job and as a teammate that will always be there to support others.

In this role, I had P&L responsibility for 9 manufacturing sites and 2 business units globally that served customers with needed supply and capability with ~ 1,000 colleagues and revenue support of $3.4Bn. In addition, I lead the successful start up and expansion of two API facilities to enhance supply reliability across the top products in the company. \n\nPrior to this role I was the Vice President of Global OpEx developing and driving the organizational capability in Lean Six Sigma across the enterprise where he delivered an average of $25MM cost savings each year for 8 consecutive budget cycles.

At Walmart, I spearheaded the OmniQuest project, implementing a gamified system for Curbside Pickup that increased productivity by 17.5% in the first week, balancing business objectives, user engagement, and design excellence. At Finxact, I developed design strategies for intricate fintech workflows, leveraging Figma and InVision to deliver enterprise-grade solutions for payroll and financial systems.\n\nBeyond these roles, I have collaborated with global organizations such as McKesson Pharmaceuticals, Lockheed Martin, Emirates, Bentley Motors, the Department of State, and the United Nations, delivering high-impact design solutions in fast-paced, regulated environments. My expertise spans end-to-end UX execution, including user research, design systems, stakeholder alignment, and product roadmapping—ensuring that every decision is rooted in data-driven insights and business strategy.\n\nWith my unique blend of UX leadership, product strategy, and hands-on execution, I am confident in my ability to drive scalable, customer-focused solutions that enhance user experiences and achieve measurable business success.",

He is skilled in both the business and technical sides of e-commerce websites.

He is always committed towards doing things the right way, even if it involves greater difficulty and effort. He'd rather have a long term success than a short term fix that will break later."

He thinks challenges through logically, weighs the choices, and recommends solutions. The strides he made (in a short time) improved our eCom performance enormously, with every aspect of the funnel climbing into market-leading stats. He’s self-motivated yet collaborative. And he’s a nice person. I would work with Purk in heartbeat again. "

        "description": "As the Key Accounts Director for Pro Towels, the leader in the towel category for the promotional product industry, I work closely with distributors that are heavily involved in the sports markets, universities, smaller colleges and schools, all the way up to the big leagues. This is a very important market for Pro Towels, and we are constantly looking to partner with our distributors to help market to these sports teams and show them the value of our product line. If you need a rally towel for a game day giveaway, look no further than Pro Towels! If you need some T-shirts decorated for that game on Saturday night and your local decorator can't turn it fast enough, look no further than Superior Decorating. If you’re looking for some creative ways to market to some of these teams, give me a call -- I can help!\n\nResponsibilities that come with my role at the company include, but aren’t limited to: developing and growing national accounts and distributor relationships; helping cultivate Pro Towels into programs and business for the future; growing our national account list; building a brand through our industry to reflect a company of integrity and quality, while having fun doing it.\n\nWith 24+ years in sales, customer service and operations, I can utilize my creativity and problem-solving on behalf of our clients. With my experience, I am excited to bring knowledge and innovative ideas with my heavy sports marketing background to help grow the Pro Towels Family to the next great level. I am known as a straight-shooter who treats her clientele as she’d like to be treated: with fairness, honesty and respect.",

Jeanna always found a way to work with me to find a solution. It may require a little flexibility by all parties but always ended with a positive outcome; landed the sale, delivered the goods on time and within the agreed upon amounts. \n\nAdditionally, Jeanna is just a fantastic human being. A true pleasure to work with, someone I’ve grown to trust explicitly and therefore became my go-to vendor for any item she could offer (and some she couldn’t, never hurt to ask). I regularly refer other people to her, knowing that they would receive the same high-quality service I came to expect when dealing with Jeanna."

I combine deep marketing execution with data & analytics (yes, dashboards are my happy place :)\n\nOver the past 10+ years, I’ve worked with 100+ businesses – from early stage startups to Fortune 1000. Built data-driven marketing systems that are predictable and scalable.\n\nA few of the wins we’ve engineered:\n→ 67% drop in CPL within 3 weeks\n→ 5x ROI on paid media for a niche B2B client\n→ 700% revenue growth in a legacy business\n→ Passive talent funnel built for a global enterprise\n\nThere’s no plug-and-play blueprint. Every growth problem needs a tailored fix.\n\nIf you're scaling, stuck, or just looking for an honest strategy plan for your business, check my premium section.",

Penn understands that no one sales the same. He took the time to learn what I excelled in and what I could improve on. He took the time to train me one on one and taught me valuable skills that I still use to this day. He took the time to learn who what drove us to succeed, then held us accountable every day to make sure we accomplished those goals. "
