        "description": "I believe partnerships are made between people and the companies we work for benefit from those relationships. Over the past year I have had the privilege of getting to know and work with one of the finest Partner Managers. Just as a cat always lands on its feet, Jennifer has the ability to always conjur forward motion. She can breath life into dead opportunities and bring to focus the things that matter. We have been able to accomplish quite a lot over the past year in terms of strategy and groundwork for renewing a global partnership which I have to say is a tremendous chore. She listens and hears what my intent is. Jennifer moves mountains and understands how to get access to the right people in a  timely manner. Jennifer has built a tremendous network and knows how and when to leverage it. I constantly challenge her with my \"wish list\" and she is able to come through (somehow) on those items. Jennifer is more than willing to go to bat for us with her leadership team. \nI can imagine that a large global partner can be very demanding but I never feel rushed nor do I feel it is too much. If it is not a natural gift she has spent years honing her craft and to manifest this everyday is cause for applause. I am very appreciative of her and look forward to harvesting the fruit from the sowing we have done this year. Lets keep the pressure on and the progress going! All my best and Thank you for your partnership Jennifer!"

Being able to work quickly and provide reliable information was critical, and Skyler's attention to detail and ability to methodically step into a root cause for an ask were crucial. He was a very valuable asset to the team and demonstrated clear, pragmatic thinking in a very time and quality sensitive situation. I'd recommend him for any role requiring the ability to conduct excellent decision making in a fast-paced or ambiguous environment."

        "publishedAt": "mSphere · Nov 1, 2018",
        "description": "Viruses utilize a number of host factors in order to carry out their replication cycles. Influenza A virus (IAV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both infect the tissues of the respiratory tract, and as such we hypothesize that they might require similar host factors. Several published genome-wide screens have identified putative IAV host factors; however, there is significant discordance between their hits. In order to build on this work, we integrated a variety of \"OMICS\" data sources using two complementary network analyses, yielding 51 genes enriched for both IAV and RSV replication. We designed a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based assay to screen these genes against IAV under robust conditions and identified 13 genes supported by two IAV subtypes in both primary and transformed human lung cells. One of these hits, RNA binding motif 14 (RBM14), was validated as a required host factor and furthermore was shown to relocalize to the nucleolus upon IAV infection but not with other viruses. Additionally, the IAV NS1 protein is both necessary and sufficient for RBM14 relocalization, and relocalization also requires the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding capacity of NS1. This work reports the discovery of a new host requirement for IAV replication and exposes a novel example of interplay between IAV NS1 and the host protein, RBM14.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) present major global disease burdens. There are high economic costs associated with morbidity as well as significant mortality rates, especially in developing countries, in children, and in the elderly. There are currently limited therapeutic options for these viruses, which underscores the need for novel research into virus biology that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. This work extends existing research into host factors involved in virus replication and explores the interaction between IAV and one such host factor, RBM14.",

        "description": "I had the privilege of supporting Derreck as his finance business partner during his time as VP of Transportation, and I can confidently say he is one of the most impactful operational leaders I’ve worked with.\n\nOver a period of 1–2 years, we partnered closely to deliver tens of millions of dollars in transportation savings—an achievement that wouldn’t have been possible without his strategic clarity, operational discipline, and relentless focus on execution. Derreck has a rare ability to drive complex business strategies forward by aligning cross-functional teams and pushing people to bring out their best.\n\nEven though I didn’t report to him directly, the impact of his leadership extended well beyond his direct team. His mastery of the OKR model brought not just structure and precision, but a culture of accountability and alignment that influenced how I approached my own work.\n\nWhat sets Derreck apart is his resilience and calm in the face of complexity and change. No matter how dynamic the business environment became, he led with focus, composure, and a solutions-first mindset. He also has a genuine commitment to team development—he pushes people to grow, leads by example, and creates space for others to stretch and succeed.\n\nDerreck is a true testament to what capable leadership looks like—he can maneuver through complicated changes in business and strategy and still deliver more than what’s committed. If you’re looking for someone who can not only execute strategy and deliver results, but also influence the entire chain through a culture-first approach, then he’s your person"

        "description": "As Director of Supply Chain Technology at Saks Global, I reported to Derreck in his role as VP of Transportation.\n\nDerreck fostered a culture of continuous improvement within our supply chain, emphasizing visibility, accountability, and innovation across departments. He was not only willing to embrace calculated risks but also leveraged strategic decision-making to drive efficiency and cost savings. His leadership in carrier selection and supply chain optimization directly contributed to tens of millions of dollars in annual cost reductions during my tenure.\n\nBeyond his operational expertise, Derreck was an exceptional leader and mentor. He created an open environment where I felt encouraged to share ideas and concerns, knowing they would be heard and considered. He actively supported my career growth, ensuring I was engaged in strategic planning and long-term visioning. His feedback was always fair and leveled, and empowered me to think differently and push for better.\n\nI highly recommend Derreck as a supply chain leader, and I will always champion his success—both professionally and as a friend."

(VCC)  I was asked to lead the delivery team to design, deploy, and deliver all the technologies and develop the team required to operate the business. We required a solution for voice, Internet, Data, Wi-Fi, Video Broadcast, Video Conferencing and Web-Cast as well as Digital Signage Kiosk, and support a highly automated LEED Platinum building infrastructure.This building would also need to support the Vancouver 2010 Olympics as the Internationa Broadcast and Press Centre. Along with this we develop a product design, pricing and a sales model to sell this capability into the convention industry. In 2010 the VCC was recognized as one of the most technologically advanced convention centres in the world. While providing an outstanding level of customer  service Bell's technology at the VCC has contributed to Vancouver attracting some of the most prestigeous conferences in the world like Siggraph and TED talks.",

I've watched her advocate for her teams, and consistently show up as a servant leader.  \n\nShe is also very enjoyable to work with- sharing humor, personal stories, and interest in others.  She has the ability to remain calm through any storm, and serve reliably as a leader.  \n\nI would highly recommend Leah for leadership roles that require organization, strategy, complexity, and the ability to work through people."

Her collaborative nature weaves the needs and perspectives of diverse stakeholder groups into comprehensive and well-informed solutions. Her work has bridged gaps between siloed teams, and her unbiased advocacy and leadership has amplified and uncovered opportunities for improvement across a vast array of channels including Customer Service, Finance, Inventory, Marketing, Retail, Supply Chain, and Technology. \n\nIn a world of endless competing priorities, Leah consistently demonstrates a deft ability to contextualize the needs of the business and forge results through disciplined, but creative approaches. From a technical perspective, her work is sound and thorough, delivering on key initiatives time and time again. Her pragmaticism kept projects on budget and on time, while her unwavering inclination to support those around her continued to propel cross-functional efforts toward progress, no matter the obstacles. Her well of knowledge runs deep, and its beneficiaries are widespread.\n\nIt was a joy to work with Leah, and a privilege to learn from her. She has been a pillar of support for countless teams and team members, and she has left an indelible mark on both the culture and operations of Rad Power Bikes. Her technical expertise, cross-functional comprehension, and dedication to her team and those around her make her a collaborator and leader of a rare caliber. She brings with her impressive experience, an immense portfolio of success, and a skillset that she continues to expand and hone with every opportunity, and I cannot wait to see what she does next with it."

    "about": "As a senior technology leader with 25 years of multi-faceted industry experience, I have dedicated my career to driving business growth and transformation through innovative digital solutions. My journey has spanned leadership roles across top-tier organizations, including serving as the VP of Digital Engineering and VP of Employee Engineering at Starbucks, and consulting for leading brands like Marriott and Sweetgreen through my company, Fitch Technology and User Experience LLC.\n\nMy expertise lies at the intersection of technology and business, where I excel in digital engineering, mobile development, cloud infrastructure, e-commerce, design thinking, and process reinvention. I have a deep understanding of emerging technology and business trends, which enables me to design and implement solutions that not only meet current needs but also anticipate future demands.\n\nIn particular, during my 17 years at Starbucks, I was instrumental in leading numerous innovative technology and digital transformation initiatives that had a profound impact on both customer and employee experiences. Notable achievements include:\n\n►  Scaling the Starbucks Card digital reload platform from $10M to $7B.\n\n►  Leading engineering teams to deliver Mobile Pay, which was the largest proximity payment service until 2023, only surpassed by Apple Pay.\n\n►  Driving the development of Mobile Ordering in 2014, which now accounts for over 30% of Starbucks' North American revenue.\n\n►  Integrating the My Starbucks Rewards program with engineering solutions, contributing to over 50% of Starbucks' North American revenue.\n\n►  Spearheading the digital transformation of the employee experience, significantly improving technology engagement scores from 39% to 70% within two years.\n\n\nIn closing, whether it’s optimizing franchise technology, leading complex digital transformations, or pioneering new approaches to technology operations, my goal is to deliver measurable outcomes that drive value for both the business and its customers.  The scope of my experience spans numerous industry segments – with heavy emphasis on Retail, Hospitality, E-Commerce, Education, and Consumer Goods – and I’m always happy to chat with any individuals or organizations facing challenges within my areas of expertise!",

CloudFront integrates with other Amazon Web Services to give developers and businesses an easy way to distribute static, dynamic content and video to end-users with low latency, high data transfer speeds. There are no long term contracts or required minimum commitments - you pay only for as much or as little content as you actually deliver through the service. Since launching publicly in November, 2008 CloudFront has added a wide variety of customer requested features including private content, streaming media content (both live and on-demand), invalidation, and custom origins. Amazon CloudFront had over 20,000 active paying customers by November, 2011 doubling the number of customers from the same time the previous year. You can learn more from the CloudFront presentation link below. Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable DNS service designed to give developers and businesses a reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications. \nI had several other teams that are not yet public but also hiring.

I had not even finished my initial training when I was already making decisions with my Managing Partner on how to lead our team in those uncertain times. \n\nWashington was the first state to approve a lockdown, so we had no precedent in that office or the company. This was a business that did not know how to operate remotely, as their day-to-day was all in-person (Insurance & Investments). We also had to manage the morale in our office and pay attention to their needs, as they had never done before. I reached out to others in the Home Office to receive all the information needed to continue my (self) training in the company and the industry.",

Once the hiring process was completed, he was continually checking that everything was running smoothly. Ernie was also looking to enrich his knowledge and understanding of the Cloud and Architecture trends in order to better screen candidates. Ernie is a great guy and a real asset for any talent acquisition team that is looking for a top notch individual. "

When he is on the phone with a client or candidate he treats them both with the same respect no matter what their title is. He always takes time on the front end to listen to his clients/candidates needs so he can ensure they will be happy with the end result. I would recommend Ernie to any employer (or job seeker!) and am confident this level of service distinguishes him from other. "

What makes AI Tinkerers special isn't just global scale—it's curation. Every attendee is screened as an active builder. No pitches and zero fluff. When everyone in the room is worth talking to, magic happens. We're the builders who are setting the pace for the industry.\n\nMy entrepreneurial background includes scaling Crowd Cow to $50M+ revenue and founding companies acquired by Upwork and Whitepages. As President of Madrona Venture Labs, we launched Mighty AI (acquired by Uber) and ReplyYes (acquired by Nordstrom). Now I actively invest in and advise early-stage AI startups.\n\nWe're living through the most exciting time in history, and the best innovations happen when smart people collaborate on real implementations.",

The system included a software process control system, home-grown reputation system and hundreds of freelance writers from the US, UK, Canada and around the world. I started this as a solo founder working nights and weekends while still full time in my prior role at WhitePages and over time built a small team of incredibly talented software engineers early in their careers to help.\n\nWithin a year or two the kinks had been worked out and we had established a two-sided marketplace with decent liquidity (~$85K / month). Around that time I received interest from each of the two largest online work marketplaces to buy the company to integrate into their marketplaces. It may have been the wrong choice but in the end rather than continue to bootstrap and grow the company organically, I decided to sell MediaPiston to oDesk in September of 2011 where I joined as VP.",

The last point is not to be under-appreciated. Some people fall prey to the short-term temptation of taking the popular/convenient path of least resistance, even if it is not the right thing to do. Joe is the type of leader who always seeks to do the \"right\" thing. I give Joe my strongest recommendation as a business partner, entrepreneur, and leader in the tech community."

        "description": "Why do we know more about the origin and flavor of the coffee beans in our cup of morning brew than about the steak on our dinner table? Why do we delight in the differences between a Zinfandel and a Cabernet, but not even know that breeds like Belted Galloway or Murray Grey exist?  For too long, beef in America has been relegated to commodity status. But a craft beef revolution is underway across America, and it’s delivering better steak. Follow Ethan Lowry, Joe Heitzeberg, and Caroline Saunders as they meet the farmers, butchers, and chefs making the craft beef revolution possible, and along the way, learn how to become a craft beef connoisseur yourself.",
