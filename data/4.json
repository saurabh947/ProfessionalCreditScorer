        "description": "During my tenure at Ford, I closely collaborated with Lars for over two years in the CTO office, where I served as his direct reporting manager. As the Principal Software Architect Leader for Ford's Software Defined Vehicle Platform, Lars exhibited exceptional leadership, overseeing a diverse team of 10-20 managers, architects, software developers, and engineers. His role involved defining, scoping, and delivering foundational components for SW Defined Vehicles. Noteworthy achievements include managing large initiatives like designing architectures for vehicle-cloud communication, such as service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based Edge Device Frameworks and secure gRPC-based device-cloud transport middleware layers.\n\nLars's contributions were pivotal in executing Ford's connectivity roadmap, showcasing strategic vision and innovation. Beyond technical expertise, he forged robust partnerships across Ford's divisions, demonstrating versatility in areas like device management, OTA updates, ML Ops Platform, Digital Twin, Vehicle Services API, and software-defined 'Dynamic Data Structures.' In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Lars for leadership positions requiring technical proficiency, strategic vision, and effective team management."

Lars served as the Engineer 4 (one of the higher engineering positions) at EHI (Enterprise Mobility). He played the role of Enterprise Foundational API Services Architect in shaping the technical direction for Foundational Components for the Rental Fulfillment team.\n\nLars demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate complex technical challenges, providing strategic direction to our teams. He was instrumental in driving innovation and efficiency in our API services architecture, ensuring that our infrastructure was not only robust but also aligned with industry best practices.\n\nOne of Lars's standout achievements was the introduction of the ‘Foundational Components’ concept, where he led the team by authoring ‘Foundational Components Primer’ internal documentation. He consistently showed a deep understanding of emerging technologies and trends, applying his knowledge to enhance our API services and infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, Lars effectively communicated technical concepts to a diverse audience of technically capable peers equally wanting to share and learn.\n\nIn addition to Lars's technical acumen, he was a driving force in championing a ‘quality productivity’ focused work environment. Lars advocated for efficiency.\n\nIn summary, Lars is an invaluable asset to any team or project, and I wholeheartedly recommend him for any role that demands a combination of deep technical expertise, leadership, and a proactive and pragmatic approach to innovation. He played an indispensable role in advancing Foundational aspects of Enterprise Mobility’s API Services Architecture, QA and Infrastructure as Code practices, leaving me with an enduring positive impact both personally and professionally."

Early on, we realized the critical role that customized financial strategies play in achieving financial security to reach a stage in life that allows you to focus on those things that are most important to you.\n\nAs life and business gets more complex and your aspirations higher, a second pair of eyes and the comprehensive personal guidance of a financial advisor may become invaluable.\n\nMy team and I primarily serve a selected group of successful business owners and professionals both virtually and in-person across the country.\n\nOur core mission is to empower our clients to make clear, informed decisions that align with their personal aspirations and financial goals. For that we use an established process to put all the pieces of the puzzle together, by understanding what's important to you, building personalized strategies to help you reach your goals and partnering with you throughout your life to keep you on track.\n\nSince 2019, my Austrian-Jamaican-U.S. family and I have lived in the beautiful city of Doral, Florida, where I engage in volunteer activities and community events, as well as speaking engagements to promote financial wellness and literacy.\n\nMy academic background includes a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and an MBA from California Lutheran University.\n\nBook a free consultation today and enjoy a complimentary review of your current financial setup knowing that there will be no cost to you, nor any obligation.\n/*********/\nFor instructions to opt out of Edward Jones commercial messaging and other important disclosures, see www.edwardjones.com/disclosures/social-media.",

As a further progression in the field, this study embarks on incorporating the subjective elements of the decision making, given the inadequacies of the strict quantitative approach. The proposed investment model fundamentally acknowledges funds allocation as being a tangible expression of a company’s strategy and utilizes a linear programming approach towards seeking an optimal decision choice when considering both the financial and non-financial benefits associated with capital expenditures."

He was involved in almost all decision-making regarding the long-term product goals for the company, and then worked with the engineering team to produce an effective and workable development plans. Sylvain took it upon himself to shield the engineering team from the vagaries of business development that are common to struggling startups to ensure that the team could be focused and productive at all times. I think Sylvain would be a valuable addition to any company seeking to make its engineering department more efficient and productive"

        "description": "Jim Lyon is one of my absolute favorite suppliers.  He tells you what he's going to do, does it (and then some) and always shoots straight.  He tells stories that'll make your sides split (although he used the analogy of \"hi-test\" gasoline with me and a millennial customer who was left scratching his head asking, \"what's hi-test?\"  That made me laugh even more.  But seriously, what I love about Jim is that he's got his eyes open for every possible opportunity to help the customer.  Even if it's something Jim doesn't sell, he will share his ideas with customers and tell them how to get it done.  Jim's old school and always picks up the phone and doesn't hide behind email and texts.  He's got the courage to tell it like it is, and the knowledge and experience to back it up.  You won't find a guy with more integrity than Jim.  Wish all my suppliers were as engaged as he is.  Oh, and he runs a really interesting and motivating sales meeting.  Can't say enough good things about this guy.  Hoping to beat him in golf someday."

    "about": "Stan Rubin is an experienced leader with extensive expertise in global corporate governance, finance, transformation, turnaround management, compliance, and operations.\n\nKey Attributes:\n• Corporate Governance, Enterprise Risk and Internal Control\n• Problem Solving, Strategic Planning, Leadership & Collaboration with Multi-Cultural Teams\n• Post-Mergers Integration, Anti-Money Laundering Compliance, and Operating in a Regulated Industry\n\nAs Ocean Bank's Chief Risk Officer, Mr. Rubin oversees activities designed to mitigate risks for the organization, including executing the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, managing corporate governance, and serving as the primary liaison with regulators. He was CFO and CRO until 2024, when he transferred the CFO role to his deputy, whom he had mentored ed since hiring. During Mr. Rubin's tenure non-performing assets decreased from over 15% of total assets to less than 0.5%, liquidity as a percentage of deposits increased from 28% to 55%, a profit was recorded in 2012 after multiple years of losses and has remained profitable, and capital more than doubled without a capital injection.  Consequently, the organization’s regulators terminated a Cease & Desist Order that had been in effect since 2007. Ocean Bank is an incredible turnaround success.\n\nMr. Rubin successfully managed the integration of Citibank's acquisition of two large institutions in Central America across 6 countries, including integrating 3 finance teams in 5 of the countries, reducing legal entities from over 100 to 50, and establishing strong internal control processes. After a major internal control failure in Citi's Canadian cards businesses, Mr. Rubin successfully transformed all processes and reengaged a disillusioned team.  Mr. Rubin established the Citi's Latin American shared service center. Mr. Rubin guided Venezuela’s business through a volatile economic period when the central bank allowed the Bolivar to float. Mr. Rubin established anti-money laundering and FDIC Insurance Act (i.e., Sarbanes Oxley for banks) processes & controls across 18 countries and territories in Asia and the Middle East. Mr. Rubin successfully managed the integration of multiple European acquisitions and played a critical role in a legal entity restructuring in Germany enabling the immediate recognition of a US$250 million tax benefit. \n\nMr. Rubin played a leading role in American Express's acquisitions of businesses in the Philippines, Thailand, and Australia, innovative card launches in Thailand and the Philippines, and wealth management products in the Philippines.",

He was very engaged to prepare me for the interview and I could see that he had studied my CV and experience thoroughly.\nAfter that it seemed that the whole Interex is a well-oiled machinery for the contract part, all the accounts creation for time registration. And whenever I had questions, assistance was immediate.\nAfter the on-boarding at the project I was contacted a couple of times to share the experiences and just see how it was going."

Successful in coding much software, some from scratch, fixed others, in different (symbolic) languages and platforms. Derived models, simulated their properties, compared them with others and validated them with experimental data. Accustomed to work with SMEs from different branches. Managed people. Completely trilingual (English, Spanish, Swedish).\n\nCuriosity is always driving me in the search of understanding the unknown in life. The \"what ifs\" and \"whys\" of things and people. Not surprisingly, I'm always studying or interacting with people, when time allows it. I've lived, studied, worked or conducted research in different countries at world class institutions.  My quest has taken me from engineering to mathematics and statistics, from interacting with people to making friends across borders and cultures. \n\nR (RStudio/Posit, knitr, Markdown, Quarto, Shiny) | | Python | SQL | Machine Learning | SAS | MS Office 365 | Matlab | Maple | Mathematica | AWS | C/C++ | MPI parallel | LATEX | Linux/Unix System | High-performance computing clusters | Computational Flows | Tableau , etc.\n\nMy ORCID (open researcher and contributor ID) is: 0000-0002-8438-6187\n\nContact information: LinkedIn messages and mobile's text messages are replied faster (the same day) than e-mails or phone calls due to meetings, robocalls, etc. \n\nI'm a US citizen and EU citizen.\n\nThis profile is not necessarily complete and will be further updated soon.",

The key to successful to fracturing treatment in shale formation is the identification of the sweet spots. Productive shale consists of quartz, feldspar or carbonate and clays, in addition to organic matter (Kerogen). Thus it is challenging process to map the best zones to fracture. A new Fracturability index based on mineralogy has been developed to locate the best areas along horizontal wells to fracture. A good fracturability index would a long production plateau for shales.

His character and professionalism are second to none. He clearly has access to the highest levels of European banking. Mr Fried is quite selective in his involvements with clients;therefore I would suggest that any organization seeking a substantial level of funding for their projects follow his lead and be forthcoming in their dealings with him. Mr Fried requires nothing less than full disclosure from his clients,if they seek his help. Therefore, I would caution those who simply seek information, without themselves having capacity, to not waste Mr Fried's or their time. However, correspondingly, those with capacity will find his capacity very much to their liking.Reliability and resolve are the virtues that Mr. Fried brings to the table for those seeking the most direct path to project funding. Thanks Mitchell for all your assistance in the past. Terrance M (RTD Global Enterprises)."
