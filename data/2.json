Leveraged Nagios, and custom templating and meta-configuration files to rapidly create the environment. This allowed QBO to go from a reactionary mode with no trending and using multiple monitoring solutions to a single solution that had consistent, actionable and useful alerts. I took the iniative to train level-1 techs in the NOC to handle many alerts to reduce the load of the on-call engineer.\n\nCreated a object-based platform using in PHP and MySQL. This tool keeps temporal state of the production environment in a database so that it can be programmatically queried later on. This tool includes a framework that I wrote that allows for rapid development of tools to do any number of things such as taking action on certain criteria, or trending. Much more powerful tools are of course possible.\n\nResponsible for Quick Books Online (QBO) which included application layer operations such as deployments, project planning, problem tracking and resolution, and capacity planning. Worked closely with the development team to help improve overall quality of the service.\n\nPlayed the lead role when QBO was attacked by a world-wide phishing scam. I worked directly with the networking, corporate security, and customer service teams to directly decide and guide how to mitigate the threat.

        "description": "Fuel-Cell Vehicles have gained reasonable popularity for its low emission, long driving range, and eco-friendly features. A converter of bi–directionalpower flow stands between the energy management system and the dc bus connected to the load through the inverter. Many converter topologies have been proposed for FCVs can be observed in the Electric vehicle market. Hence, there is a need of assessment of the popular topologies of the bidirectional DC-DC converters required to judge. This paper presents analysis and simulation studies between two converter topologies which employ inherent soft switching technique and set forth the suitable performance observed in PSIM 9.0 simulations.",

        "description": "This paper deals with designing a simulation model of test setup for deriving information for analyzing the discharging characteristics of a battery in accordance with a predefined discharging profile. As an initial step, in order to determine the parameters from the discharging circuit, the requirements of the batteries were collected. A DC-DC boost converter of 4 kW input power and maximum input current of 100 A is designed for discharging the source battery in a controlled manner using PI controller. From a variable input voltage, boost converter is able to step-up the input voltage to a higher constant dc output voltage using feedback technique. The resistive load is used initially and later the dc motor load is used as a variable load. The constant output voltage of 50 V is obtained. The simulation is done using MATLAB/ SIMULINK.",

Privacy Management and Compliance value driver\n \nOver time, we’ve observed how CISOs and other leadership teams leverage visibility into personal data to meet their MBOs. This motivates us to solve deeper business problems. \n \nCISOs are amazed at the level of information they can now see. They gain a level of visibility they have never had before, which helps them prove their value within their organizations and gives them relevance at the board level.\n \nMy passion for leveraging network and security big data analytics and Network Analytics to drive enterprise business value, has only increased over time, in large part due to the presence of committed and talented team members around me.\n \nI also take pleasure in the opportunity to work with some of the brightest CISOs and other Security and Compliance leaders in the industry.\n \nI love staying up-to-date on Network Analytics, Data Privacy, and Machine Learning topics, and discussing their role in driving business value.\n \nI enjoy connecting with innovative minds in this space.

    "about": "Robert Sutton is an organizational psychologist and New York Times bestselling author.  He is author of eight books, including (with Huggy Rao) \"The Friction Project: How Smart Leaders Make the Right Things Easier and the Wrong Things Harder.\" He studies leadership, organizational change, innovation, scaling, and workplace dynamics. At Stanford, he is Professor of Management Science and Engineering (emeritus) and a faculty fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He co-founded the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, Institute of Design (“the d school”), and Center for Work, Technology, and Organization. \n\nSutton speaks on friction in organizations, other challenges of leading at scale, and fundamentals of modern leadership. To book him, contact Charlotte Perman at United Talent Agency at perman_c@unitedtalent.com or 212.647.6307. \n\nSutton won the Eugene L. Grant Award for Excellence in Teaching, and numerous other Stanford teaching awards.  He won awards for the best paper of the year in the Academy of Management Journal and in the Academy of Management Review.  Sutton was named as one of 10 “B-School All-Stars” by BusinessWeek, “professors who are influencing contemporary business thinking far beyond academia.” The London Business School honored him with the Sumantra Ghoshal Award for Rigour and Relevance in the Study of Management. \n\nSutton has published over 200 articles in academic and popular outlets.  His books include\"Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths, and Total Nonsense\" (with Jeff Pfeffer),  selected by the Toronto Globe and Mail as the best business book of 2006. \"The Knowing-Doing Gap\" (with Pfeffer) was chosen for Jack Covert and Todd Sattersten’s \"100 Best Business Books of All Time.\"  Fast Company's Bill Taylor described \"Weird Ideas That Work\" as \"the smartest and most original take on leadership and organizational creativity that I’ve read.\" Sutton's \"Good Boss, Bad Boss\" and \"The No Asshole Rule\" are New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestsellers. Scaling-Up Excellence (with Rao) is a Wall Street Journal bestseller and Financial Times picked it as among the best six management books in 2014. \n\nOn \"The Friction Project,\" Adam Grant wrote: “This is the ultimate guide to diagnosing and fixing the problems in your organization. No one knows more about making work better than this pair of experts, and they’ve produced a remarkably insightful, engrossing, evidence-based, and actionable read. If every leader took the ideas in this book seriously, the world would be a less miserable, more productive place.”",

They either hire junior executives who can't deliver results or invest in an expensive full-time CxO before they are ready. PV works with companies in a fractional model, offering experienced senior executives to solve immediate leadership needs without the full-time cost.\n\nHighlights of my engagements ...\n\n• President (fractional): Autonomous cars - developed, launched, and led the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium in partnership with GM, Toyota, Arm, DENSO, Bosch, and Continental.

My engagements bridge the initial need for leadership until a full-time executive is identified and retained at a later point - I often run the search for my full-time replacement.",

    "about": "I’m Susan Lindeque, Founder & CEO of Avestix Group and Co-Founder & CEO of BANX, a woman-led force torching the decayed foundations of finance, banking, and wealth creation. \nMy story begins in the vast, rugged landscapes of South Africa, where the rhythm of the land taught me resilience and the value of vision. In Silicon Valley, I found my crucible. Here, where ideas collide and the future is coded in real-time, I saw the potential to rewrite the rules of wealth. \n\nI lead Avestix, BANX, and the Avestix Fortuna—Women Empowerture Network to unleash world-shattering technologies—AI, Blockchain & Quantum finance—that obliterate barriers and fuse wealth with wellness.\n\nWith 35+ years across three continents, I’ve raised and managed over $1B in real estate, equity, and venture capital, delivering above average returns for families, institutions, and visionaries. I’m rewiring finance for liberation, banking for user control, and wealth creation for prosperity and purpose. \n\nAvestix uses AI to smash investment gatekeepers, blockchain for unbreakable trust, and quantum finance for exponential gains.\n\nBANX, our self-custody operating system, is a financial uprising. It annihilates centralized control, arming you with sovereignty over your wealth via AI-driven insights, blockchain transparency, DeFi, and alternative investments. \n\nWe’re crushing AI trust issues, crafting fraud-proof identities, and demolishing systemic barriers, embedding wellness into wealth’s core.\n\nThe Avestix Fortuna—Women Empowerture Network, named after Fortuna, goddess of luck and fate, liberates every woman—newborns, elders, widows, those rebuilding—to seize her destiny and make bold financial moves. \n\nIt starts with education: Investing in Yourself, Mastering AI, Embracing Financial Literacy. \nYour Wealth—Your Control.\n\nI host EMPOwerture: Tech Frontiers, a weekly podcast amplifying trailblazers—especially women—exploring blockchain, AI, robotics, cybersecurity, fintech, and quantum finance to forge 2030’s wealth and well-being revolution.\n\nBeyond disruption, I’m obsessed with golf, red wine, Thai massages, and travelling. Travelling keeps me ahead, spotting trends early. In Silicon Valley, Marley, my Labrador, and Senorita, my son’s feisty Frenchie, ground me with their nonconformity. \n\nMy curiosity fuels seismic impact, and I’m devoted to philanthropy, uplifting children with disabilities and women’s financial freedom.\n\nConnect at www.avestix.com or DM me. Serious inquiries only. This isn’t for everyone—and it’s not supposed to be. \n\nLet’s ignite the unimaginable.",

        "description": "Bright, innovative, visionary, driven, motivated with a heart for her family, friends and business associates. This is how I have experienced Susan for the past 35 + years that we've been friends. She has given me an opportunity to get out of my comfortzone by introducing me to the Crypto market and Global stocks a few years ago. Since then I am constantly following her on LinkedIn and read almost every post as it's always insightful and relevant to current global developments. Susan is a trustworthy person with whom you always know where you stand. Her ability to stay calm while having so many balls in the air, always blows my mind. I raise my hat to Susan for the road she was prepared to walk the past 30+ years for I know it wasn't always downhill."

        "publishedAt": "BOSS Magazine · Apr 24, 2025",
        "description": "Sixty-three percent of financial services firms in the U.S. and Canada reported increased fraud last year, with digital fraud accounting for half of their overall losses.\n\nThis may not be surprising given that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that “extreme financial losses” for all businesses have quadrupled since 2017 due to cyberattacks.\n\nIt’s little wonder then that Lexis Nexis found that nearly half (48 percent) of financial services firms took steps in 2024 to further mitigate fraud, which includes educating consumers and leveraging the “cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and biometric- and behavior-based authentication methods” to combat fraud.\n\nYet one sector in the financial services sector, family offices — firms catering to the investment and wealth management needs of high-net-worth individuals and families — appears to be lagging behind others in the industry when it comes to making the fight against cybercrime a top priority.\n\nSusan Lindeque, CEO of Avestix Group, an alternative investment firm that works with family offices, isn’t entirely surprised to learn that these wealth management firms are operating behind the curve in protecting their organizations from cybercriminals.\n\n“If family offices lack cybersecurity awareness, it may be because the leadership teams in those firms have other priorities,” Lindeque says. “When JP Morgan surveyed family offices, they were asked who was in charge of internal decision-making. More than one-third said CEOs or Presidents. Chief Financial Officers made decisions for 28 percent of the family offices surveyed while Chief Investment Officers were in charge about 25 percent of the time. There was no mention in the study of Chief Information Security Officers or similar cybersecurity-focused roles serving in leadership roles whatsoever.”",

        "description": "The emergence of distributed renewable power generation capacity across the urban landscape presents a new challenge to power utilities. Micro-generation creates transient pools of capacity that must find available load to consume it. The traditional grid infrastructure is to lossy, to complicated, to focused on centralized generation, in a word, it's inadequate.\n\nMicro capacity is best consumed as close as possible to where it's generated. What if utilities could send the load to the capacity instead of distributing the capacity on a grid? In a few years, cities will be filled with roving autonomous electric vehicles periodically looking for the cheapest recharge opportunity. We propose to harness this mobile \"load\" to dynamically match localized capacity by predicting micro-capacity and guiding (via price incentives) recharge seeking vehicles to the optimal charging station.",

Applying Big Data, Deep ML, AI, based upon probability functions of stochastic processes operating on economics random variables governed by the laws of quantum physics; My solution is similar to what Nassim Taleb has been lecturing and writing about in Black Swan. In short, I am trying to replace and deflate the Bubblenomics of the Keynesian,  Chicago, and Austrian schools of economics with a totally different system of economics and financials where the velocity of money is optimized and kept as constant among people. I called it Quantum Economics. A stable coin, any coin, and any digital currency including BitCoin, could circulate in this system. My intellectual property is in the financial and economic system of Banking as a Platform utilizing the currencies. Moreover, I introduced two digital currencies in my site as solutions A and solution B. Unfortunately, Zuck borrowed my solution B without my permission, added a couple of macroeconomically insignificant, slow varying bonds, to it, and branded it as Facebook's Libra.\nwww.ReplaceTheFED.com",

They also cited a technicality issue: I had submitted color images to my patent to illustrate the work flow. USPTO never informed me of the latter until after my patent went abandoned!

Conventional software tools for this purpose use the well known Navier-Stokes partial differential equations used to describe motion of fluid substances by means of computational fluid dynamics using a finite element method to solve the equations and optimize design of building air ducts for carrying warm and cool air through a building. Instead here the HVAC system is initially simulated using an electrical circuit design tool such as SPICE, where room volumes correspond to electrical capacitances, heat sources correspond to electrical resistances, and air flows to electrical currents in a complex R-C electrical circuit. The goal is to improve energy efficiency in terms of the amount of energy used to heat and cool air, and also the amount of energy used to circulate the air through the air ducts.",

The trapezoidal cells each have a larger surface area than that of the adjacent triangular shaped cell. The electric current produced by each trapezoidal cell is approximately the same as that of the smaller triangular shaped cells, which are subject to more intense incident light due to the beam's Gaussian spot profile.",

Emma has a strong ability to bridge communication gaps and set up team members for success all on top of a superb technical foundation.\n\nWhen it comes to managing her engineering team, Emma shines. She truly understands her team members' strengths and areas for growth, creating opportunities for both professional development and meaningful contributions. Her knack for breaking down tasks and maintaining stellar documentation ensures that projects are completed efficiently, without sacrificing quality or customer experience. She was also fantastic at making complex engineering projects understandable to everyone, regardless of their technical background. This skill didn't just help her own team; it helped everyone understand how to better align our work with company and product goals.\n\nWhat sets Emma apart even further is her deep commitment to our mission. She never hesitated to be an advocate for asylum and accessibility initiatives, making her much more than just an engineering leader and a critical product partner. Emma embodies the essence of mission-driven work, always striving to make the world a more compassionate and accessible place, in this case in the context of immigration.\n\nEmma was also a key part of the culture within our team. From putting together remote social events to hackathons, Emma has a talent for bringing people together, and she was a cornerstone of our positive team culture.\n\nEmma is a transformative leader who brings an incredible blend of technical expertise, managerial skill, and heartfelt passion to everything she does. I couldn't recommend her more highly for any role that seeks a multi-faceted leader with a strong commitment to impactful work. Working with her is a joy!"

This involved researching the state of the art, leveraging the existing technologies that fit, and designing and implementing the UI and middleware to make it something that really met the needs of our users.  \r\n\r\nI was particularly impressed by how flexible and capable she was in handling the variety of challenges I threw at her: clearly and extensively documenting her work so others could expand on it in the future, quickly implementing a new feature idea, going deep into debugging someone else's software, and more.  \r\n\r\nShe's a delight to work with and I look forward to seeing where she takes these talents; hopefully back to Pure at some point!  :)"

It wasn't just about finding talent, but finding a team that could align with our culture and operate like an extension of our company.\n\nIn fact, Andy and Accelerance made the whole process very smooth and painless. They matched us up with a partner who not only met the requirements but really over-delivered on actual solutions that moved the needle for us. The team they helped us onboard was proactive, professional, and truly invested in our success.\n\nWhat really sets Andy apart is his combination of deep expertise and genuine integrity. He's thoughtful, professional, and someone you can trust to get it right the first time. Working with him wasn't just a great experience-it was game-changing for our team. I can't recommend him or Accelerance highly enough."

He is very intelligent (he is a gifted strategist with strong sales, marketing, and product acumen), yet he remains open to learning and seeing things from new perspectives. He is applying all of these skills at Accelerance, where his strategic vision is transforming how the company collaborates with global partners and delivers client value.

        "description": "In Outsource or Else! How a VP of Software Saved His Company, authors Andy Hilliard and Steve Mezak offer a management fable as instructive as it is page-turning.\n\nJason Jaye is the VP of engineering at ShapeShift, a start-up in Silicon Valley developing cutting-edge fitness technology. When his CEO drops a bombshell that software development for their next product will have to be outsourced, Jason is certain that the product and the company (not to mention he, himself) are doomed. After all, everyone in the Valley knows that outsourcing software development usually equals disaster.\n\nNevertheless, the fate of ShapeShift rests on Jason s ability to navigate a safe path through uncharted waters. Enter Patrick Delaney, an eccentric, world-traveling outsourcing expert who offers Jason a compass to guide his way: the Seven Keys of Software Outsourcing, a plan for how to successfully select and work with the right global software outsourcing partner. Will Jason help his company meet its goals and bring its exciting new product to market on time? Or will the pitfalls of outsourcing software development swallow him whole before he gets the chance?\n\nThrough engaging storytelling, Mezak and Hilliard reveal the secrets of how to choose a software outsourcing partner that:\n\n* Fits your technical requirements and company culture, for optimal results\n* Delivers a quality product, at tremendous cost savings, within the needed time frame\n* Improves your innovation by leveraging the broader expertise of an offshore team\n\nOutsource or Else! offers useful, practical advice for tech leaders who want to capitalize on the many benefits of outsourcing software development and push their businesses to extraordinary new levels of success.",

        "description": "The project is a distributed alternative to both volatile and non-volatile memory. It is designed to scale or back up your codebase or data. It is built with modern design considerations and offers various features that make it a powerful tool for developers.\n\nDesign Considerations\n\nAI and Code Generation: Tig is designed with the understanding that AI generates more code than people and that AI models can apply generic code, making author bookkeeping unnecessary.\nReliability. With more code and less time to verify, reliability and signing each code and data block becomes more important.\nHash Addressing. Tig addresses code with its entire hash rather than a file name, date, or version.\nStorage and Consistency. Storage is cheaper, so simple consistency is more important than disk usage.\nChange Ordering. It considers serial change ordering obsolete compared as generative AI works on parallel versions.\nStable Codebase. A stable codebase is important, and a hash identifies an entire process memory, not just the difference.\nRevisions. Revisions need to be tested and reviewed before use. Who reviewed them is more important than, who wrote them.\nVersioning. The stable version is a highly utilized version more likely than the latest one.\nSecurity. We insist on complete isolation. Each session pointed by a root index block is isolated by its unique hash, even if they are run by the same user.\nAuthentication. Tig uses an API key for security, which can be extended with 2FA wrappers and monitoring solutions.\n\nFeatures\n\nBackup Tools: Backup tools can directly work with uploaded data easily.\nFile Addressing: The client can address the file any time with its SHA256 hash.\nData Streaming: Tig is ideal for data streaming workloads as a middle tier.\nDistributed Databases: Distributed databases are easy to merge with hash granularity similar to commit sizes.\nTemporary Directory: The temporary directory is a good candidate to prevent data leaks.",

    "about": "Leah Houston, MD practiced emergency medicine across the United States for nearly a decade before transitioning into entrepreneurship, focusing on physician autonomy and digital privacy. Having worked in 11 health systems across 3 states, Dr. Houston experienced firsthand the significant administrative burdens of the onboarding and credentialing process—an issue faced by physicians everywhere. This inspired her to pursue advanced training in AI and health technology at MIT, culminating in the launch of Evercred, an AI-powered credential data wallet designed to streamline workforce mobility and enhance patient access to physician talent.\n\nEvercred is an AI-driven credentialing automation tool that empowers physicians to become the primary source of ownership and control over their professional credentials, data, and right to work. Our earliest revenue-generating beta version of the physician-facing wallet is now live, allowing physicians to manage and share their credentials effortlessly.\n\nWe are also developing an enterprise-facing solution that will enable seamless data sharing and verification through API integrations. This future functionality will provide immediate, permanent, and perpetual primary source verification, revolutionizing how healthcare credentials are managed.\n\nEvercred launched in early 2025 and is now available for paid pilot projects.\n\nTo learn more, visit: https://www.evercred.com",

        "description": "HPEC was originally developed to be a decentralized identity and credentialing application for US based physicians which was originally available on the App Store and Google Play. We pivoted to an AI based web app: evercred in February 2025.\n\nIf you are a licensed physician in the US get on the waiting list for your invitation today at https://www.hpec.io/\n\nHPEC is restoring privacy and trust to the practice of medicine by first solving the problem of credentialing. The process for physicians to verify their professional identity so they can safely care for patients has been friction filled and cumbersome, until now. HPEC is built on open-sourced self-sovereign identity standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Decentralized Identity Foundation. Through the HPEC application the physician owns their non fungible credentialing information, and they become the primary source of verification of their identity and credentials. HPEC has a way for physicians to connect with each other and build, own and maintain their professional reputation separate from insurance networks and vertically integrated employment models. HPEC creates a conduit for physician to own and control their digital interactions first with each other, and then with patients and other stakeholders laying the foundation of our future decentralized healthcare ecosystem. \n\nLearn more at our website https://www.hpec.io/",

    "about": "I help businesses of all shapes and sizes use AI to get more done.\n\nI'm currently the founder/CEO of Relay.app, where we're building an easy-to-use platform that enables everyone to create AI agents that work for them.\n\nI also post actionable tips about the latest AI tools. I try to keep my recommendations concise, practical, and honest about what AI can and can't do today.\n\nYou'll see a few different types of posts from me:\n1. Demonstrations of specific AI agents that you may find useful\n2. Stories about my own adventures (and misadventures) with using AI tools\n3. Updates on what we're doing at Relay.app\n\nHere's what led me here:\n- I started my career as a PhD student in the Multi-agent systems group in the AI Lab at Stanford, where I worked with Yoav Shoham and Dan Ariely on AI applied to product tools.\n- I dropped out of my PhD to become the founder/CEO of Timeful, an AI-powered calendar that helped users find time for their tasks, habits, goals and projects.\n- After Timeful was acquired by Google in 2015, I became a PM Director at Google, responsible for Gmail, Google Calendar, the Workspace Developer Platform, and more.\n- I left Google in 2021 to start Relay.app.\n\nIf you're looking for ways to get started with AI, follow me here on LinkedIn or check out the Relay.app YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIENacxDzvxb7mWIXZRZtAQ.\n\nI'm doing my best to help everyone make the most of AI, and I really appreciate feedback on what I should be talking about more!",

Connections to 100+ tools enable our AI agents can work effectively on your behalf.\n2.

        "publishedAt": "Journal of Bionic Engineering · Jan 29, 2013",
        "description": "A microclimatic layer of the green façade is proven to have specific temperature and flow conditions\non the building envelope. Lower temperatures and wind velocities, and higher relative humidity in the\nmicroclimatic layer are characteristics of vertical greenery systems, which cause lower energy\nconsumption for the cooling and heating of buildings. Despite innovative architectural solutions, there\nare some drawbacks to applying vertical greenery on building envelopes. In this study, a bionic façade\nthat mimics the positive effects and eliminates the disadvantages of green façades is presented. The\nbionic façade consists of bionic leaves, which are made of photovoltaic cells and an evaporative\nmatrix. A real scale experiment was carried out in the summer to evaluate the potential of the cooling\nefficiency of the microclimatic layer and a new photovoltaic cooling technique. The results show good\nagreement of the thermal performance of the bionic and green façades and up to 20.8 K lower surface\ntemperatures of photovoltaic cells, which has effects on the up to 6.6% higher daily electricity yield.",

His attention to detail and work ethic are without parallel. He takes complete ownership of every problem he encounters and follows through until he has resolved it. Beside that he has incredible ability for creative thinking and problem solving and can take on any mechanical or technical issue. Very good attitude and a pleasure to work with on any assignment, you won't find a problem that he can't fix! \r\n\r\nWhile working at the Hilton and Grant I watched him overhaul both hotels and bring the Hilton in Del Mar into perfect working order within 6 months of taking over as Chief Engineer. This was for a hotel where flooding and lack of hot water were common daily problems. His work at the US Grant speaks for itself! The renovation and cost saving measures he implemented on his own accord saved the property hundred of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nFinally, he has complete mastery of technical ability and he will see the job through completion."

His commitment to engineering excellence and innovation enabled the team to deliver impactful solutions, even under tight deadlines and evolving requirements.\n\nWhat truly sets Ashik apart is his people-first leadership style. He invests time in understanding each team member’s strengths and career aspirations, fostering an environment where professional growth is both encouraged and recognized.\n\nI highly recommend Ashik for any leadership position.

Ashik’s leadership skills, particularly in managing distributed teams and implementing SDLC best practices, were evident as he successfully led five scrum teams within the Card Issuing and Customer Experience domains.\n\nAshik brought a wealth of expertise in software design, system architecture, and project management to the table, effectively transitioning the core platform from a monolithic architecture to microservices. This strategic shift enabled the platform to manage up to 10 billion cards, setting new benchmarks in the financial technology space. His data-driven approach and strong alignment with executive vision were instrumental in optimizing both operational efficiency and product innovation.\n\nUnder Ashik’s guidance, the card issuing team grew from 3 to over 40 engineers, and he was key in mentoring several direct reports into managerial roles. His focus on team development and fostering a collaborative environment significantly contributed to Marqeta’s journey to a $16 billion IPO. Moreover, Ashik revamped the interview and hiring processes, leading to substantial growth in the workforce and strengthening the company’s engineering capabilities.\n\nAshik’s ability to align technology initiatives with the company’s broader goals, coupled with his strong interpersonal skills and commitment to operational excellence, makes him an invaluable leader. His contributions at Marqeta were pivotal in driving both technical advancements and organizational success. Any organization would be fortunate to have Ashik at the helm, driving innovation and team success."

You can use AWS DMS to migrate your data into the AWS Cloud, between on-premises instances (through an AWS Cloud setup), or between combinations of cloud and on-premises setups. With support for all major relational and NoSQL databases, DMS is a fitting choice for many data migration projects. In this seminar, we will touch base on Amazon’s choice of designing DMS based on database transaction logs as well as how you can use Terraform for DMS",

Whether it’s connecting people to people, people to opportunities, or capital to promising ideas, I love it all. \n\nIt’s a passion I’ve carried throughout my journey with the World Bank, MIT, and as an investor. And it’s also why I'm building CoffeeSpace, the infrastructure for early-stage team formation — starting with an AI-powered platform that connects founders to cofounders and early hires through high-signal matching.\n\nWhen I’m not working, you’ll likely find me at the gym, analyzing markets, or crafting a new Magic: The Gathering deck. I’m also a proud Coldplay fan—‘Paradise’ and ‘Clocks’ are on constant repeat in my playlist (and probably outplay my next 20 favorite songs combined).\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, feel free to connect!",
